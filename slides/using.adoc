Using JGroups
=============
author: Bela Ban belaban@yahoo.com

Overview, API and configuration of the most common protocols.

What is it ?
------------
* Clustering library (only *a single JAR* (~2MB))
* Provides
** Reliable _one-to-many_ or _one-to-one_ communication
** Can use _IP multicasting_ or TCP
* Customizable _protocol stack_
** Users can add, remove, replace, enhance, or even write their own protocols

* Ships protocols for
** Network communication (transport)
** Membership discovery
** Failure detection
** Lossless and ordered transmission
** Network split handling and subsequent merging
** Notification when nodes join or leave the cluster (membership)
** Flow control
** Fragmentation
** Compression, encryption, authentication

* Building blocks
** Method invocation across a cluster
** Distributed caches, counters, locks


Architecture I

Architecture II
---------------
* Users deal mainly with the _channel_ (`JChannel`)
* The protocol stack is setup according to an XML config file
* A sent message passes the stack _top-down_
* A received message is passed up through the stack _bottom-up_


Common classes
--------------
* `Address`
** Identifies a node (=member) in a cluster
** Can be used as destination to send a message to a node
** A node's address can be retrieved from the channel: `JChannel.getAddress()`

* `View`
** List of addresses, lists all cluster nodes
** Order is the same in all nodes
** Example: `A[4] (2) [A, B]`
*** View was created by (coordinator) A and the current cluster contains A and B

* `Message`
** This is sent and received by cluster nodes
** Destination and sender's addresses
*** Destination == null: send to entire cluster
** Payload (`byte[]` buffer)
** Flags
** Headers (used mainly by protocols to add information, e.g. sequence numbers)
* Example:
[source,java]
----
Message msg=new Message(null, "hello")      // "hello" is serialized into a byte[] buffer
                .setFlag(Message.Flag.OOB); // set flag OOB
channel.send(msg);
----

ReceiverAdapter
---------------
* Callback to receive messages (push-model) and view changes
* Users typically extend it and override `receive()` and `viewAccepted()`:
[source,java]
----
public void receive(Message) {
    Address sender=msg.getSrc();
    String greeting=(String)msg.getObject();
    System.out.println("received " + greeting + " from " + sender);
}

public void viewAccepted(View view) {
    System.out.println("received view " + view);
}
