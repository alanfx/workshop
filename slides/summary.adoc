What have we learned ?
----------------------
* Use of JGroups, API and building blocks
* Advanced features
* Design of major protocols
* Admin tools, e.g. probe.sh
* Flexibility of the protocol stack
** Write your own protocols, or extend existing ones
* Don't be shy to look into the code, it won't bite you :-)



Outlook
-------
* JGroups 4 is the next major version (end of 2015, tbs)
* Java 8 as baseline
* Use of Java 8 features, e.g. `CompletableFuture` returned by `RpcDispatcher.callRemoteMethods()`
* Use of NIO.2
** No copying between applications (e.g. Infinispan) and JGroups
** Multiple transports (UDP *and* TCP at the same time), pick transport per message
** Efficient message passing between processes on the same box (shared memory)



Before you go
-------------
* For questions use the mailing lists / IRC
* If you liked this course, please recommend it to others !
** There are 4 courses in 2015 and 4 (tbd) in 2016
** Possibly a separate course on jgroups-raft (tbd)
* Thanks, and enjoy working with JGroups !
