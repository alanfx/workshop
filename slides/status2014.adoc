JGroups 3.2
-----------

* Current version: 3.2.12.Final



RELAY2: multi-site clustering
-----------------------------

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1433[JGRP-1433],
  http://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1401[JGRP-1401],
  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1521[JGRP-1521],
  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1519[JGRP-1519],
  https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1525[JGRP-1525]

* Provides clustering between multiple sites
** Successor to RELAY (which allowed for only 2 sites)
* RELAY2 is added to the of the stack and relays both multicast and
  unicast messages between sites (local clusters) 
* For documentation go to
  http://www.jgroups.org/manual-3.x/html/user-advanced.html#Relay2Advanced



I8N logging
-----------
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1475[JGRP-1475]
* Use of ResourceBundles to internationalize certain warn and error
  messages
* The +JGroups/conf/jg-messages*.properties+ files contain the
  translations
* Currently, only German is supported, but support for any language
  can be added easily, and without recompilation, e.g. by adding
  +jg-messages_fr.properties+ (for French) to the classpath


Suppress identical log warnings
-------------------------------
* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1518[JGRP-1518]
* Sometimes we get a lot of log messages about the same problem,
  e.g. messages from a non-member, from a different cluster or from a
  member running a different version of JGroups 
** If we get 20'000 messages from a non-member, we'd log 20'000 warnings...
* We can now suppress indentical warnings for a given period of time
  (60s by default), so the logs don't get blown up beyond proportion
