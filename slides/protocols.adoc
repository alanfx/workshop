Protocols in JGroups
====================

Transport protocols
-------------------
* Bottom-most protocol in a stack
* Interacts with the network
* Main tasks
. Serialization and sending of messages to other nodes
. Deserialization of network buffers into messages and passing those up the stack
* Most of the resources of a node (sockets, thread pools) are located in the transport protocol
* Available transports:

[width="90%",cols="2,10", frame="topbot",options="header"]
|====
| Name | Implementation
| UDP | Sends datagram packets (to single destination) or multicast packets (to all cluster nodes). Requires IP multicasting to be enabled.
| TCP | Uses TCP sockets. A message sent to the entire cluster (N nodes) is sent N-1 times. 1 thread per connection.
| TCP_NIO | Same as TCP, but uses NIO.2: thread pool to handle _all_ connections. Currently not supported. Will get revamped in 4.0
| TUNNEL | Talks to external process (GossipRouter) to send/receive messages. Can be used to connect nodes behind firewalls.
| SHARED_LOOPBACK| Dummy transport to connect members running inside the same process. Used for unit testing

Discovery
---------
* Discovers the initial membership
* Used to find out who the _existing coordinator_ is (to send a `JOIN` request to it)
* Implementations:

[width="90%",cols="2,10", frame="topbot",options="header"]
|====
| Name | Implementation
| PING | Sends discovery request as multicast (requiring `UDP` as transport)
| TCPPING | Defines a static list of nodes (IP addresses and ports) to contact, e.g. `initial_hosts=A[7800],B[7800],C[7800]`
| MPING | Uses its own multicast socket to multicast discovery requests. Used when the transport
          doesn't support multicasting, e.g. `TCP`
| TCPGOSSIP | Contacts one or more external processes (`GossipRouter`) to find the initial membership for a given
              cluster. Each node registers with the GossipRouter(s) on startup.
| JDBC_PING | Uses a database to store the membership for a given cluster. Each members adds its own information at startup.
| FILE_PING | Uses the file system to store membership information. On startup, each members writes its own information
              to the (shared) file system
| S3_PING, GOOGLE_PING| Uses a cloud store for membership information. More impls include AWS_PING, SWIFT_PING,
                        RACKSPACE_PING, Kubernetes, Zookeeper etc
|SHARED_LOOPBACK_PING| Requires `SHARED_LOOPBACK` as transport, delegates all discovery requests to the transport

Merging
--------
* When failure detection splits a cluster into multiple subclusters, e.g. `A15={A,B,C}` and `D15={D,E}`, merging tries to
  merge the subclusters back into a single cluster:
** The _subcluster coordinators_ `A` and `D` periodically send out merge messages
*** `A` sends `{coord=A,addr=192.166.1.5:50500,view=A15,cluster="demo"}`
*** `D` sends `{coord=D,addr=192.168.1.6:60500,view=D15,cluster="demo"}`
** When `A` or `D` encounter a message from another node claiming to be coordinator for the same cluster, they
   engage in a protocol to
*** Exchange information about their respective subclusters
*** Agree on a _merge leader_ who
**** Generates a `MergeView` (`A16={A,B,C,D,E}`)
**** Has all subcluster coordinators install the MergeView
**** All subcluster coordinators except one (e.g. `A`) step down
* The merging itself is done by `GMS`; the merge protocol only notifies `GMS` that a merge is needed

Failure detection
-----------------
* Failure detection checks for crashed or unresponsive members and _suspects them_
** It _doesn't remove suspected members_ (that's the task of `GMS`)
* Noe that members which leave _gracefully_ (e.g. via `JChannel.disconnect()`) are never handled by failure detection
* Implementations:

[width="90%",cols="2,15", frame="topbot",options="header"]
|====
| Name | Implementation
| FD_ALL | Every node periodically multicasts heartbeats. Each member maintains a table of members and timestamps and
           resets the timestamp for P on reception of a heartbeat or message from P. +
           If a member's timestamp exceeds a threshold, a suspect(P) message is sent to the coordinator, which tells
           `GMS` to handle the suspicion. +
           `GMS` then removes P and installs a new view excluding P. `FD_ALL` works best with `UDP` as transport as
           heartbeats are multicast.
| FD_SOCK | Members of a cluster form a logical ring, with each member creating a TCP connection to the member to its
            right. E.g. in `{A,B,C}`, `A` -> `B` -> `C` -> `A`. +
            When `C` crashes, `B` will get notified that the TCP
            connection to `C` was closed and send a `suspect(C)` to the coordinator (`A`), who then excludes `C` from the view.
| FD | Same as `FD_SOCK` but instead of a TCP connection, heartbeat messages are sent to the neighbor to the right. If
       a timeout elapsed without getting a response or traffic from the neighbor, a suspect message is sent to the coordinator.
| FD_HOST| To detect the crash or freeze of entire hosts and all of the cluster members running on them. It is not
           meant to be used in isolation, as it doesnâ€™t detect crashed members on the local host, but in conjunction
           with other failure detection protocols, such as `FD_ALL` or `FD_SOCK`. +
           Can be used when we have multiple cluster members running on a physical box. For example, if we have members
           `{A,B,C,D}` running on host 1 and `{M,N,O,P}` running on host 2, and host 1 is powered down, then `A`, `B`,
           `C` and `D` are suspected and removed from the cluster together, typically in one view change. +
            By default, `FD_HOST` uses `InetAddress.isReachable()` to perform liveness checking of other hosts, but if
            property `cmd` is set, then any script or command can be used. `FD_HOST` will launch the command and pass
            the IP address ot the host to be checked as argument. Example: `cmd="ping -c 3"`.

Reliable transmission and ordering
----------------------------------
* A sender S assigns monotonically increasing sequence numbers (seqnos) to messages
* Receiver R receives messages from P and delivers them (up the stack) in seqno order
* Negative acks: the receiver only asks a sender to retransmit a message if a gap has been detected, e.g. `S5` -> `S6`
  -> `S8`: here, message `7` from `S` is missing so `R` asks `S` to resend message `7`.
* Positive acks: the sender continues to periodically retransmit a message `M` until the receiver `R` has acked
  `M`, or `R` left the cluster

|====
| Name | Implementation
| NAKACK2 | For sending messages reliably and in (sender) order to all cluster nodes. Uses negative acks.
| UNICAST3 | For sending unicast (point-to-point) ordered messages. Uses a mixture of negative and positive acking.
|====
* Ref: http://www.jgroups.org/manual/index.html#ReliableMessageTransmission



Message stability
-----------------
* Only applicable to one-to-many (= multicast) messages (`NAKACK2`)
* When multicasting messages with `NAKACK2`, receivers store all messages in order to deliver them in order, and
  to possibly resend messages to members missing them
* However, keeping messages around indefinitely increases the heap used and eventually members run out of memory
* `STABLE` is an agreement protocol which runs periodically (or based on received bytes) and removes messages which
  have been seen by everyone
* E.g if we have members `{A,B,C}` and receive
** From `A`: `{A:15,B:25,C:3`
** From `B`: `{A:14,B:29,C:5`
** From `C`: `{A:15,B:27,C:5`
** Then the minimum vector is `{A:14,B:25,C:3`.
*** All members can now remove messages `14` and lower from `A`, `25` and lower from `B` and `3` and lower from `C`

Group membership
----------------
* Handles new member joining, existing members leaving or crashing (suspicions) and merging
* Adds new members to the view, removes left or suspected members from the view and installs a new view
* Also handles merge events sent by a merge protocol
